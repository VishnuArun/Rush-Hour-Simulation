### Project Description

This project investigates the idea of multiple-server queues. 

Consider an office building with 12 floors in downtown Minneapolis. During the morning rush hour, from 7:50 am to 9:10 am, workers enter the lobby of the building and take one of the four elevators to their floor. The time between arrivals of the customers at the building varies in a probabilistic manner every 0-30 sec, and on arrival each worker selects the first available elevator. When the worker enters an elevator and selects a floor, the elevator waits 15 sec before closing its doors. If another person arrives within the 15-sec interval, the waiting cycle is repeated. If no person arrives within the 15-sec interval, the elevator departs to deliver all of its passengers. As people arrive in the lobby and no elevator is available, a queue begins to form in the lobby.


Some workers are complaining that they spend too much time riding the elevator, and other complain that there is considerable congestion in the lobby during the morning rush hour. What is the real situation? Can management resolve the complains my more effectively scheduling or using the elevators? Some questions to consider are the length of the longest queue, the average waiting time of a person in the queue, the delivery time (the time it takes a worker to reach his or her floor after arriving in the lobby), and the average and maximum time a worker spends in the elevator.
